After discussion with the ACJU publishing department, I decided to publish the ACJU's Logo as an open source project on github. If you are interested, you also can contribute for this project by cloning the code to your computer.

{% highlight ruby %}
git clone https://github.com/acju/ACJU-Assets.git  [your project name]
{% endhighlight %}

once you cloned the project, you can start modifying your content and push it. once we recive the push request, if we see it as a good pice of work, we will approve and pull your changes.

{% highlight ruby %}
git add -A
git commit -m "THE CHANGES"
git push 
{% endhighlight %}

We belive, bunch of you will contribute to this project. Good code is always welcome.
